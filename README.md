Data analysis of a reverse cationic flotation process

# Predicting the effectiveness of a Froth floating process

**June 2019**

**Project Description:**

We will use this dataset to analyse and predict a (reverse cationic) Froth floating process having the two aims:
* What is the best predictor for the iron concentration of the product?
* Can the data set be used to predict the impurity of the product (by silicate concentration)?

**Data Description:** 

This notebook deals with the analysis of a reverse cationic flotation process of a real production environment. The data (including its documentation) is accessible through kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process
